Web Development Node.js Minor Project


TO_Do_List App:


A simple To Do List application built with Node.js and Express and MongoDB

I built a TODO List app. 

In this app, users can create to-do lists, where they can add list of Tasks. 

The Task created by user then should be stored in the Database.


How to run the app locally:

   1.Run  npm install  to install all needed dependencies
   
   2.Then start the server using  node index.js 
   
   3.Navigate to your browser  http://localhost:7000/  to view the app
